Snake Game Description :-
Game Objective:
  ->The objective of the Snake game is to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.
Game Mechanics:
  ->Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in a specific direction. The player can change the direction using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
  ->Food: Randomly placed on the screen. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and a new piece of food appears at a random location.
  ->Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
Using ArrayList in Java:
  ->Managing the Snake's Body:
     ->An ArrayList can be used to store the coordinates of each segment of the snake's body. Each element in the ArrayList represents a segment of the snake, typically as a Point or a custom 
       class holding x and y coordinates.
